# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `lib/` holds the TypeScript source shipped to consumers; each file exports a focused domain module (Character, Prefectures, NationalHolidays, etc.) that composes via `lib/japanjs.ts`.
- `test/` contains Vitest specs mirroring the modules (`Character.test.ts`, `Prefectures.test.ts`, ...); add new specs alongside modules.
- `src/` and `public/` back the Vite demo site used for manual verification; keep sample usage lightweight.
- `dist/` is generated by `npm run build`; do not edit by hand.
- `playground/` is an isolated Vite app for exploratory changes; update when features need interactive validation.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` sets up dependencies for both the main package and the playground.
- `npm run dev` launches the Vite demo at `src/`; useful while iterating on documentation and UI checks.
- `npm run build` compiles the library (`tsc`) and bundles it (`vite build`); run before publishing.
- `npm run test` executes the Vitest suite in `test/`; pass `--runInBand` if snapshots or timers collide.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint against `lib/`; ensure a clean result prior to review.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Write TypeScript with 2-space indentation, single quotes for strings, and trailing commas disabled to match existing files. Public exports use PascalCase (e.g., `Character`, `Prefectures`), while helper variables stay camelCase. Keep modules tree-shakable: export pure functions or classes without side effects. Let ESLint's recommended configs (`eslint.config.js`) guide spacing and no-any usage; fix warnings immediately.

## Testing Guidelines
Use Vitest (`describe`/`it`) with `*.test.ts` filenames under `test/`. Mirror the module structure so every new export ships with a corresponding case. Prefer data-driven tests over snapshot assertions; verify locale-sensitive strings explicitly. Aim for full coverage of edge cases (half-width/full-width, holiday boundaries, Morse spacing). Run `npm run test -- --coverage` locally before major refactors.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow Conventional Commits (`fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`) and keep scopes short; bilingual descriptions are welcome. Reference issues in the body when relevant and list any breaking changes. Pull requests should summarize behavior, include test evidence (`npm run test` output or screenshots), and confirm docs or playground updates when behavior shifts.
